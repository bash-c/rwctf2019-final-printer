There is a network printer server running on ubuntu 18.04.
Pwn this service and achieve the following steps.

1. spawn a calculator
2. read the file(in txt mode) we have printed 
3. print this message `hacked by {your_team_name}`

You are **NOT** allowed to access the real printer deivce.
Hackers, enjoy it!

> ps: you can try at most 3 times in 10 min per demo chance.

Hint for printerï¼šYou may add a virtual printer if you want to debug the print server locally.
